### Introduction

I am an avid Manga reader so I have modified a browser extension to notify me for a new chapter of my Favs! 

**WARNING** *I need to clean up the code!* but here is Github [repo](https://github.com/fmcyamwe/manga-notifier)

----------------

Also created a small extension to help me in my job search...

Code and [info here!](https://github.com/fmcyamwe/jobby)
