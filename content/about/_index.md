I am a software developer by formation, curious and energetic - that applies technology to solve real-world problems. Personally, I’m easygoing, sociable, a fast-learner, and natural leader. I love self-teaching to acquire new skills and insights.

A deliberate jack of all trades, master of none; I am motivated and curious about how technology can enhance user experiences across various domains. I have a strong sense of responsibility toward my team, clients and peers. I daresay people often appreciate my positive, can-do attitude (most people anyway :).

On the technical side, I’m a specialized generalist, bridging different areas to build and scale reliable systems powering successful tech products, including mobile (Android), web development, DevOps/SRE and data solutions. My work/experience spans a variety of languages and frameworks across both backend and client-side development.
